# Systems Project2 - MyShell
Names: Angela Mashuryan and Tiffany Yang


Creative Group Name: Yangela

Code/Documentation:

//     Every function you write must have a function header comment describing the arguments, return value and what the function does.
//     Use modular design liberally. This is a large program.
//     You should have a readme file with the following:
//         All group member's names
//         Your group's "creative team name" where you can optionally flex on other groups by making a really good name.
//         A description of what features your shell implements
//         A description of what features you attempted to implement but were unsuccessful
//         Any bugs or things you want me to know about your program
//         I am much more forgiving of reported bugs than bugs I discover while testing
//         A copy of every function header
//     This project should use separate C files as necessary.
//     Restrictions on input (to make your job easier):
//         Command line arguments will be separated by single spaces. (Except the semicolon)
//         I will only test a single pipe |
//         I will only test up to one >
//         I will only use the > syntax, not the 2> or &>
//         < would go after the first command only,
//         > would go at the end of the command only.
//         e.g.

//         a < c.txt | b  > d.txt

//         This would cause: c.txt goes into program a, the output of a goes into program b, the output of b goes into the file d.txt )
//     If you would like to implement other features after getting these ones down, please do. Look at what bash does and see what else you can do!
